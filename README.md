# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-Basic-Neural-Network

#### Project Overview
This project expands on the previous breast cancer classification by incorporating deeper machine learning techniques. The goal is to explore more advanced algorithms or deep learning models (e.g., neural networks) to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

#### Files in the Repository:
- `Project.DeepLearning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training using advanced ML models, and performance evaluation.
#### Key Steps in the Project:
- Data Loading: The same Breast Cancer dataset is used as in the logistic regression project.
- Preprocessing: Features are standardized using `StandardScaler`.
- Model Training: Advanced machine learning models are trained, such as neural networks.
- Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and possibly other metrics.
